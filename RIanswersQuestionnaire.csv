EMSO ERIC does not have a central repository yet. Multiple and distributed data repositories are currently in use, including custom-made internal repositories, cloud (e.g., AWS) repositories, and third-party repositories. Third party repositories include: EMODnet, PANGAEA, CORIOLIS, OCEANSITES, CMEMS, MOIST.IT, BODC, SEANOE, and SeaDataNet. An interim file-based centralized data repository is available through an web server.","In addition to the repository software deployed by third-party repositories, custom-made (e.g., based on Python and Django,) based on 52-North SOS, THREDDS, OpenDAP and ERDDAP. EMSO ERIC does not use repository software such as Fedora/hyrax or similar. The interim file-based centralized data repository is based on an Apache HTTP server.","Currently, EMSO ERIC does not have a central metadata system but it is distributed across Regional Facilities and integrated into different systems using PostgreSQL, THREDDS (netCDF files), raw netCDF files and custom solutions. Metadata is also stored in third-party repositories (e.g., MOIST.IT, SeaDataNet, EMODNet, DataCite, data.gov.ie, data.marine.ie, BODC, SEANOE). ","The use of PIDs varies across the different regional facilities (e.g., at least two facilities do not use PIDs). PIDs used include: DOIs (e.g., via DataCite and PANGAEA), NetCDF Oceansites ID attribute (.nc file name), and NetCDF EGO ID attribute (.nc file name).","In most of the cases the PIDs are manually (e.g., via PANGAEA: https://wiki.pangaea.de/wiki/DOI).","PID registration providers include DataCite, and PANGAEA Data Publisher.","Although it varies across regional facilities, in some cases the PID records used to store data attributes are DataCite metadata fields.",It is unknown if the third-party repositories are certified.,"The main EMSO ERIC website does not provide repository policies; however, some regional facilities provide repository policies (e.g., http://data.plocan.eu/thredds/DataPolicy.pdf).",Repositories registered in a registry include EMODNet registry and data.gov.ie.,"The different regional facilities implement their local persistency guaranties policies; however, EMSO ERIC does not currently have unified persistency guaranties. Facilities may implement generic agreements on ocean observing with central and regional governments but there are not explicit persistency guaranties.","Most popular data types include time series, sound, profiles, trajectories, model forecast data, CTD and vessel underway, fisheries effort, bathymetry, image, video.","Preferred data formats include NetCDF, CSV, WAV, JSON, MSEED, Excel, O&M.","In general data includes metadata headers including NetCDF Oceansites Profile metadata (http://www.oceansites.org/docs/oceansites_data_format_reference_manual.pdf), NetCDF EGO format metadata (https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00239/34980/), standard NetCDF CF headers, subset of CSV/ASCII are served as SDN ODV with the included semantic header, metadata are included directly in NetCDF e.g., dimensions, variables, global attributes (principal investigator, principal investigator email, principal investigator url, institution, project, network, metadata link, geospatial information, time coverage information, data type, conventions, metadata conventions, netcdf version, publisher information, license, etc.).","It varies across regional facilities, some provide data catalogues and search functionalities (e.g., opensearch) and tools that provide search functionalities such as ERDDAP. In addition, third party repositories provide search on data.","EMSO ERIC does not currently register the schemas in a common registry; however, some facilities use schemas/formats already present in a common registry.","The metadata schemas mostly used in EMSO ERIC include XML, NetCDF (e.g., NetCDF Oceansites, NetCDF EGO), ISO19139, Excel.","It varies across regional facilities but metadata typically uses well-defined semantic concepts and use standard conventions such as Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for variables standard names (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/65/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) and geometries (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html#appendix-examples-discrete-geometries), and NERC Vocabulary Service (e.g., http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/, http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/ for NetCDF).","It varies across regional facilities but mechanisms for including provenance include NetCDF Oceansites profile metadata attributes (site_code, platform_code, wmo_platform_code, principal_investigator, institution, network) and NetCDF EGO metadata attributes (platform_code, wmo_platform_code, institution,  institution_references, sdn_edmo_code - SeaDataNet EDMO code of the institution-, contact, author, data_assembly_center,  principal_investigator, principal_investigator_email, observatory, deployment_code, deployment_label).",In general PIDs are included in the metadata description where they exist. An example is the Òpublisher_urlÓ in NetCDF Oceansites.,"The primary storage formats for metadata are heterogeneous across regional facilities and include custom solutions (e.g., human-readable PDF), relational databases, Drupal and GeoNetwork database, WAV files headers for acoustic data, and metadata are also stored in a PostgreSQL database, then used for creating JSON files which feed  the production of  NetCDF files. ","Export formats include HTML, XML, JSON, RDF, all formats produced by NetCDF conversion toolboxes, all formats compatible with .wav PCM, Excel.","It varies across regional facilities but they include methods compatible with THREDDS, OAI-PMH, CSW (available as standard with GeoNetwork).","EMSO ERIC does not currently have a centralized search engine; however, repositories used by the Regional Facilities and third-party systems provide metadata search engines (e.g., http://www.moist.it/search/html and data.marine.ie).","Yes, EMSO ERIC data and metadata is integrated into third-party search engines such as EMODnet, CMEMS, CORIOLIS, and dataset metadata as Schema.org on both local catalogue and ERDDAP server.","In general EMSO ERIC metadata make statements about access; however, this is not uniform across regional facilities.

The major gap is the integration of the different regional facilities in a way that data findable in a more uniform manner.","EMSO ERIC data is accessible using different mechanisms (e.g., third-party systems such as EMODNet and CMEMS portals). Integrating data access is an undergoing effort to harmonize data access and, as a result, improve its accessibility. The lack of a single point of access (e.g., API) is another gap that EMSO ERIC is currently addressing.","EMSO ERIC data is interoperable in general (e.g., it is integrated into different third-party repositories); however, integration efforts are required to improve interoperability, including more mature standardization, better semantics and standard metadata.","EMSO ERIC data is reusable in general; however, data curation processes require integration in order to improve the level of re-usability (e.g., harmonize the use of PID such as DOIs at a higher level of abstraction).
